            When you dream of death, dying or dead people, notice how you feel in your dream. While many people fear that their dreams predict a literal death, another approach would suggest that you’re dreaming about an aspect of yourself. Death represents the end of something, both personally and culturally, and moving on to something new. Often, when you dream of someone dying, it’s valuable to consider what that person represents to you, what part of yourself you fear losing or what aspect of yourself or in culture is coming to an end and preparing for a new beginning.
